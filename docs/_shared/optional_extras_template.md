### Optional extras

The capabilities below are **opt-in** and not required to adopt calibrated explanations. Enable them only when you need additional telemetry, PlotSpec visualisation, CLI or registry governance, or compliance integrations. Each callout must:

- Identify the tooling as optional and provide a minimal activation snippet.
- Link to the relevant governance or compliance note when telemetry is involved.
- Clarify that primary quickstarts and notebooks run without these steps.

> 💡 Keep this section at the end of the page so core workflows stay calibration-first.
