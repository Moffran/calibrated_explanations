# Plugin overview

This page is an index for contributor-facing plugin documentation. The
release plan references `docs/plugins.md`; the detailed guidance and examples
live under the contributor and appendices sections. Use the links below as the
canonical entry points.

- Contributor plugin contract and "hello, calibrated plugin" example:
  `docs/contributor/plugin-contract.md`
- External plugin index and aggregated extra guidance:
  `docs/appendices/external_plugins.md`

If you are contributing a plugin, follow the guidance in the contributor
document and register your entry point under the `calibrated_explanations.plugins`
group. For optional speed-ups, the curated `external-plugins` bundle is
described in the appendices.
