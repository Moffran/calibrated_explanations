# Advanced contributor tooling

Reach for these optional extras when you need deeper instrumentation or
performance tooling while maintaining the calibrated explanation contract.

- {doc}`../plugin-contract` – Revisit the contract before layering advanced
  options on top of existing plugins.
- {doc}`../../foundations/how-to/tune_runtime_performance` – Shared executor and
  cache guidance; reuse rather than reimplement parallelism.
- {doc}`../../foundations/governance/optional_telemetry` – Telemetry policies and
  consent messaging.
- {doc}`../../foundations/how-to/plot_with_plotspec` – Optional PlotSpec helpers
  for plugins that emit visual artefacts.
