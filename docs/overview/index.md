# Overview

{{ hero_calibrated_explanations }}

Calibrated Explanations keeps the calibrated, interpretation-first journey front
and centre for every audience. Start with the quickstarts below, then dive into
role-specific highlights and research context.

| Classification (binary & multiclass) | Probabilistic regression |
| --- | --- |
| [Run the classification quickstart](../get-started/quickstart_classification.md) and pair it with the [demo notebook](https://github.com/Moffran/calibrated_explanations/blob/main/notebooks/demo_binary_classification.ipynb). | [Run the regression quickstart](../get-started/quickstart_regression.md) and explore the [probabilistic regression notebook](https://github.com/Moffran/calibrated_explanations/blob/main/notebooks/demo_probabilistic_regression.ipynb). |

> 🔁 **Interval regression insight:** Interval guidance ships alongside the
> probabilistic regression quickstart—look for the interval notes directly under
> the primary code path.

## Highlights

- **Interpretation first:** Reuse the [Interpret calibrated explanations guide](../how-to/interpret_explanations.md) across
  factual, alternative, and probabilistic workflows, and dive into the
  [Alternatives concept explainer](../concepts/alternatives.md) for the dedicated
  walkthrough.
- **Research pedigree:** [Review the literature](../citing.md) spanning binary,
  multiclass, probabilistic, and interval regression.
- **Role-based navigation:** Practitioners, researchers, and contributors each
  have dedicated hubs with calibrated-first hero copy and governance guardrails.

## Resources

- {doc}`Research hub <../research/index>` – Publication summaries, benchmark
  notes, and funding context that underpin the platform.
- {doc}`Citing calibrated explanations <../citing>` – Reference the canonical
  papers for binary & multiclass classification plus probabilistic and interval
  regression when publishing your work.
