# Documentation section owners

Every release verifies that each section has an accountable owner. Owners lead
content updates and sign off on pre-release reviews.

| Section | Owner | Responsibilities |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Overview | Release manager for the active minor release | Update landing copy, version banner, and release highlights. |
| Get started | Release manager for the active minor release | Keep quickstarts runnable, refresh installation matrix, and maintain troubleshooting steps. |
| How-to guides | Feature owners | Ensure guides cover current workflows (pipelines, telemetry, export, plotting). |
| Concepts & architecture | Runtime tech lead | Align lifecycle diagrams, telemetry semantics, and architecture notes with code. |
| Reference | Runtime tech lead | Monitor autodoc output, schema versions, and API alias deprecations. |
| Extending the library | Contributor experience lead | Maintain plugin registry docs, contribution guide, and developer tooling references. |
| Governance & support | Contributor experience lead | Curate release checklists, PR guidance, and support channels. |

Owners coordinate quarterly audits (per ADR-022) and raise issues when sections
require cross-team updates.
