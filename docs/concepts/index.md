# Concepts & architecture

{{ hero_calibrated_explanations }}

{{ backed_by_research_banner }}

Understand the theory powering calibrated explanations across binary and
multiclass classification plus probabilistic and interval regression. Start with
interpretation and alternatives, then dive into telemetry and architecture.

| Concept | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| [Interpret explanations](../how-to/interpret_explanations.md) | Reuses notebook screenshots and walks through dual uncertainty plus the triangular plot. |
| [Alternatives & triangular plots](alternatives.md) | Explains how the triangular view pairs with rule tables for calibrated alternatives. |
| [Telemetry & observability](telemetry.md) | Documents provenance fields and opt-in instrumentation. |
| [Architecture overview](../architecture.md) | Connects runtime components, caching, and plugin guardrails. |
