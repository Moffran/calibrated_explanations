# Practitioner advanced topics

Reserve these references for teams that need optional telemetry, performance
profiling, or PlotSpec visual narratives. Each topic extends the core
explanation workflow without introducing mandatory dependencies.

- {doc}`../../foundations/how-to/configure_telemetry` – Opt-in telemetry hooks
  with privacy defaults and governance cross-links.
- {doc}`../../foundations/how-to/tune_runtime_performance` – Parallelism,
  caching, and profiling guidance for high-throughput deployments.
- {doc}`../../foundations/how-to/plot_with_plotspec` – Optional PlotSpec and
  triangular plot tooling to visualise factual vs. alternative trade-offs.
- {doc}`../../foundations/concepts/telemetry` – Conceptual framing for the
  telemetry model and its boundaries.
