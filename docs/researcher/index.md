# Researcher hub

Connect calibrated explanations back to the published literature, benchmark
artefacts, and replication workflows. This hub centralises the guidance that
used to be spread across ``research/`` and ``researcher/`` so you can navigate
from replication to advanced telemetry experiments without duplicate content.

## Start with replication

Follow the {doc}`replication/index` workflow to align your environment,
datasets, and evaluation scripts with the published studies across
classification and regression. The steps mirror the evaluation extras and data
manifests shipped in the repository.

## Explore advanced threads

When curating new benchmarks or extending telemetry experiments, jump to the
{doc}`advanced/index` lane. It houses the literature roundup and placeholders
for future research artefacts, all linked back to the same shared foundations as
the practitioner and contributor hubs.

Consult the {doc}`future_work` ledger to explore open research questions and
potential enhancements to the calibrated explanations framework.
