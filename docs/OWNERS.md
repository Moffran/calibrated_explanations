# Documentation ownership

The documentation aligns with ADR-022 and is governed by section leads. With a
single maintainer at present, the same individual fulfills each role.

| Section | Owner | Responsibilities |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Overview, Get Started | Release manager (content manager) | Keep the landing page, overview narrative, installation, and quickstarts aligned with the current release. |
| How-to guides, Concepts | Runtime tech lead (content manager) | Maintain procedural guides, configuration references, and architecture concepts; ensure telemetry instrumentation stays current. |
| Extending, Governance | Contributor experience lead (content manager) | Curate plugin authoring docs, governance policies, checklists, and contributor playbooks. |

Section owners review navigation changes, confirm crosswalk updates, and sign
release notes before each minor release.
