# Extending the library

{{ hero_calibrated_explanations }}

Contributors and plugin authors keep calibrated explanations front and centre.
Begin with the calibrated plugin example, then dive into guardrails and ADR
references.

| Resource | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Plugin guide](../plugins.md) | Builds a minimal calibrated plugin, cites ADR-024/025/026, and routes telemetry/CLI details to optional appendices. |
| [Contribution guide](../contributing.md) | Covers governance, coding standards, and ADR links for extensibility. |
