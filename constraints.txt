# Dependency constraints for development and CI.
#
# ONLY absolutely necessary constraints are included here to ensure compatibility
# where upstream packages have strict requirements (e.g., numpy version splits).
# All other dependencies use the softer ranges from requirements.txt.
#
# Update policy:
# - Add pins ONLY when CI reveals unavoidable incompatibilities.
# - Remove pins as soon as upstream fixes the issues.
