  Find and consult the relevant ADRs before making a change to calibrated_explanations.
  Use when asked 'which ADR governs this', 'check ADRs for this change', 'ADR impact
  of', 'is there an ADR for', 'which ADRs apply to plugins', 'ADR for serialization',
  'ADR for visualization', 'ADR for exceptions', 'ADR for deprecation', 'ADR for
  testing'. Provides a fast lookup from change type to governing ADR(s) and the key
  constraints each ADR imposes.

# CE ADR Consult

You are identifying which ADRs govern a proposed change and extracting their
binding constraints. ADR decisions take precedence over the release plan whenever
they conflict (execution-plan.instructions.md §3).

ADRs live in `docs/improvement/adrs/`. Superseded ADRs are prefixed with
`superseded ` and should not be consulted for new work.

## How to consult an ADR

1. Locate the file: `docs/improvement/adrs/ADR-<NNN>-<slug>.md`
2. Check `Status:` — skip if `Superseded`.
3. Read the **Decision** section to extract binding constraints.
4. Note the **Consequences** section for risk awareness.
5. Check the `docs/improvement/RELEASE_PLAN_v1.md` entry for the ADR to see
   which release milestone closes outstanding gaps.

```bash
# List all active (non-superseded) ADRs
Get-ChildItem docs/improvement/adrs/*.md | Where-Object Name -NotMatch '^superseded'
```

## Key invariants summary (most commonly hit)

### ADR-001 — Core / plugin boundary
- `core/` must never import from `plugins/`.
- New functionality → `plugins/`; delegation → via registry in `core/`.

### ADR-002 — Exceptions
- No bare `Exception` or `ValueError` in public-facing code.
- Use `calibrated_explanations.utils.exceptions.*`.

### ADR-006 — Plugin trust
- Third-party plugins: opt-in trust required (`trust_plugin()` / env var / pyproject).
- Built-ins: auto-trusted.

### ADR-011 — Deprecation
- Minimum 2 minor releases before removal.
- Legacy User API (ADR-020) exempt; follows "Major Only" lifecycle.

### ADR-013 — Interval plugin
- `predict_proba` must delegate to VennAbers/IntervalRegressor reference.
- `IntervalCalibratorContext` is read-only; plugin must not mutate it.

### ADR-021 — Interval semantics
- Invariant: `low ≤ predict ≤ high` must always hold.

### ADR-023 — Matplotlib exemption
- `viz/matplotlib_adapter.py` is excluded from coverage reporting.
- Tests run normally with `pytest --no-cov -m viz`.

### ADR-030 — Test quality
- Coverage gate: 90%+ (excluding ADR-023 exemption).
- Naming: `test_should_<behavior>_when_<condition>`.

### ADR-031 — Serialization
- All calibrators must implement `to_primitive()` / `from_primitive()`.
- `schema_version` mandatory; fail-fast on incompatible version.

### ADR-032 — Guarded explanations
- Use `explain_guarded_factual` / `explore_guarded_alternatives` for unknown distributions.

### ADR-033 — Modality extension
- Non-tabular modality code must NOT enter `core/`.
- `data_modalities` and `plugin_api_version` required in `plugin_meta`.

## Conflict resolution

When a release plan step and an ADR conflict:
1. The **ADR takes precedence**.
2. Document the conflict in the PR.
3. If the plan needs to supersede the ADR, a new ADR or ADR update is required first.

## Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] All governing ADRs identified for the proposed change.
- [ ] Status field checked (not `Superseded`).
- [ ] Decision section read; binding constraints listed.
- [ ] No ADR constraint violated by the proposed implementation.
- [ ] Release plan milestone for outstanding gaps noted and respected.
