abstract: >-
  `calibrated-explanations` is a Python package for the local feature importance explanation method called Calibrated Explanations, supporting both [classification](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123154) and [regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16245).
  The proposed method is based on Venn-Abers (classification & regression) and Conformal Predictive Systems (regression) and has the following characteristics:
  * Fast, reliable, stable and robust feature importance explanations for:
    - Binary classification models ([read paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123154))
    - Multi-class classification models ([read paper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlresearch/v230/main/assets/lofstrom24a/lofstrom24a.pdf))
    - Regression models ([read paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16245))
      * Including probabilistic explanations of the probability that the target exceeds a user-defined threshold 
      * With difficulty adaptable explanations (conformal normalization) 
  * Calibration of the underlying model to ensure that predictions reflect reality.
  * Uncertainty quantification of the prediction from the underlying model and the feature importance weights. 
  * Rules with straightforward interpretation in relation to instance values and feature weights.
  * Possibility to generate alternative rules with uncertainty quantification of the expected predictions.
  * Conjunctional rules conveying feature importance for the interaction of included features.
  * Conditional rules, allowing users the ability to create contextual explanations to handle e.g. bias and fairness constraints ([read paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63787-2_17)).
