# Evaluation and Benchmarks

This folder contains experimental scripts and notebooks used for research and evaluation. These assets are intentionally optional to keep the core package lean.

## Environment

Install optional dependencies for evaluation:

```powershell
pip install "calibrated_explanations[eval]"
```

## Notes

- Some notebooks rely on plotting; consider also installing:

```powershell
pip install "calibrated_explanations[viz]"
```

- Large datasets referenced in `data/` are not versioned for size reasons.
