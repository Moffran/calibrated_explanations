## Testing and Code Coverage
We use pytest as our testing framework and aim to achieve a code coverage of above 90% in our tests. This ensures that our code is thoroughly tested and helps identify any potential issues or bugs. We encourage contributors to write comprehensive tests and strive for high code coverage. Code coverage tests are added and monitored at [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/github/Moffran/calibrated_explanations).
