# Code Documentation Review

## Summary of Findings
- **Coverage gaps**: Automated inspection shows 131 of 513 functions (25.5%) lack docstrings, indicating incomplete inline documentation for a quarter of callable surfaces.
- **Module-level inconsistency**: Several modules (for example `perf.parallel`, `perf.cache`, and `utils.__init__`) export public helpers without any module docstring, leading to a mix of documented and undocumented entry points.
- **Style drift**: Existing docstrings mix NumPy-style sections with informal paragraphs, complicating automated tooling and reader expectations.
- **Legacy shims**: Deprecated shims such as `core.py` hold short warnings but no context about remaining lifetime or migration guidance beyond imports.
- **API surface risk**: Utility modules like `utils.helper` consolidate many user-facing helpers but only provide high-level module docs; several individual functions omit argument/return documentation.

## Severity Assessment
**Overall severity: High.**

The proportion of undocumented functions plus inconsistent formatting across subpackages creates a fragmented contributor experience and hampers discoverability for downstream users. Many utilities double as semi-public APIs for notebooks/tests, so missing docstrings materially increase the learning curve.

## Supporting Data
- Function docstring coverage snapshot: 131 / 513 functions missing documentation (25.5%).
- Modules without top-level documentation include `src/calibrated_explanations/perf/parallel.py`, `src/calibrated_explanations/perf/cache.py`, and `src/calibrated_explanations/utils/__init__.py`.
