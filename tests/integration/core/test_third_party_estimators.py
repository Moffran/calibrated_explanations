"""Skippable integration tests for third-party gradient boosting libraries.

These smoke tests verify that CalibratedExplainer interoperates with popular
scikit-learn compatible learners: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

Each test is skipped automatically if the corresponding library is not
installed in the environment. Tests are also marked as slow so they are
skipped when FAST_TESTS is enabled.
