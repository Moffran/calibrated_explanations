"""Fast explain helpers module.

This module provides fast-path helpers for explain executors. It is intentionally
lightweight and only contains exported helpers required by the package when the
fast explanation path is used. The file exists to satisfy pydocstyle's requirement
for a module-level docstring (D100).
