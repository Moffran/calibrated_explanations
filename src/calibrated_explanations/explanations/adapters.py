"""Adapters between legacy explanation dicts and internal domain models.

This module provides conversion helpers that allow constructing the
internal domain model from existing legacy dict shapes and emitting a
legacy-shaped dict from the domain model. Public APIs should not import
these directly yet; they are intended for internal use and tests.

Scope: minimal parity with current legacy fields used in tests.
