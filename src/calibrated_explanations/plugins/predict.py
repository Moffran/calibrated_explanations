"""Predict bridge protocol for explanation plugins (ADR-015).

The predict bridge encapsulates calibrated inference helpers that explanation
plugins rely on. It provides a narrow surface so plugins can trigger
calibrated predictions without depending on the concrete calibrator
implementations. The precise behaviours are intentionally conservative â€“ the
bridge is a frozen adapter owned by :class:`CalibratedExplainer` and treated as
read-only by plugins.
