## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a
public issue. Instead, use one of the following private channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred):
   https://github.com/Moffran/calibrated_explanations/security/advisories/new
2. **Email** the maintainers at helena.lofstrom@ju.se with a detailed report.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if available).
- Affected versions and environments.
- Any proposed remediation or mitigations.

## Response timeline

We aim to respond to valid reports within **5 business days**. For confirmed
issues, we will:

- Acknowledge receipt and agree on an embargo window.
- Develop and test a fix.
- Publish a security advisory and release notes once a patch is available.

If you have not received a response within the expected timeline, follow up via
email so we can ensure the report is not lost.
