# Research hub

Calibrated Explanations builds on a multi-year research program spanning
classification, probabilistic and interval regression, and uncertainty-aware
interpretation tooling. Start here to find the published literature,
benchmarks, and funding context, then drill into the dedicated pages for full
references.

## Resources

- {doc}`theory_and_literature` – Published papers, in-flight studies, benchmarks,
  and funding acknowledgements with links to replication assets.
- {doc}`../citing` – Copy BibTeX entries for binary & multiclass classification
  plus probabilistic and interval regression papers when preparing your own
  publications.
