# Researcher hub

{{ hero_calibrated_explanations }}

Connect calibrated explanations back to the published literature, benchmark artefacts, and replication workflows. This hub surfaces the theory threads that underpin probabilistic calibration and interval-aware interpretation.

## Survey the literature

- {doc}`../research/index` – Research roadmap, benchmark notes, and funding acknowledgements.
- {doc}`../research/theory_and_literature` – Full bibliography across classification, regression, and uncertainty calibration.
- {doc}`../citing` – Ready-to-use citations for papers that reference calibrated explanations.

## Build and evaluate experiments

- {doc}`../get-started/quickstart_classification` – Baseline experiments for binary and multiclass studies.
- {doc}`../get-started/quickstart_regression` – Probabilistic and interval calibration workflows for regression research.
- {doc}`../how-to/export_explanations` – Persist explanation payloads for replication packages.
- {doc}`../how-to/interpret_explanations` – Common vocabulary for factual vs. alternative narratives.

## Publish responsibly

- {doc}`../overview/index` – High-level positioning to include in abstracts and grant reports.
- {doc}`../governance/release_checklist` – Workflow gates that ensure quickstarts, fragments, and docs stay in sync before release.
- {doc}`../contributing` – Upstream contributions guide for sharing new calibration techniques.
